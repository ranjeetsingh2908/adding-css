we have three methods of adding CSS to HTML

INLINE
  Styling is added to 1 element in the opening TAG
  
INTERNAL
  Styling is added to the head element of the HTML file
  
EXTERNAL
  Stying is added to separate file and link is then mapped to the HTML file

  html => 
  <head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css"/>

  CSS Styles.css =>

  }
